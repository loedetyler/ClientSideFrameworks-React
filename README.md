Started with the EmberJS tutorial, made it all the way through and struggled with pushing it to a new repo, ended up wiping the whole project so I started over with React.<br>
Followed the React tutorial on how to build a Tic-Tac-Toe app.<br>
Racked my brain looking through documentation on how to make my app fit the SPA guidelines provided.<br>
Asked ChatGPT for clarification on what I needed to do, to which it replied with multiple more links to documentation.<br>
These included the Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial, a React guide to "Adding React to an existing project", Frontend state management, Using React without a backend, and a few others.<br>
Updated index.js to hopefully fall under the categorization of a Single Page App.
